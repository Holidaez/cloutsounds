<h1>Clout Sounds</h1>

Clout Sounds is a website clone inspiried by SoundCloud. Users can use Clout Sounds to upload, view, comment on and play music composed by themselves or other artists. I built it myself during my time here at App Academy with the goal of the project to be a recognizable clone of the popular music streaming platform as my capstone project for the program. While the styling for the site is not as difficult as some of my projects prior, Clout Sounds challenged me to go outside of my comfort zone to achieve the goals I laid out for myself during planning, I taught myself AWS which was not part of the curriculum at App Academy as well as worked under tough time constraints to build out a complete backend and frontend that I am proud to share with everyone. My goals now are to enter the job search, hopefully as a TA here at App Academy in the near future to better myself, my understanding of code, and to help the next round of fullstack engineers achieve their goals as I continue to strive for mine.
